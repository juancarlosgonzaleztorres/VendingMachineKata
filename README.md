# Vending Machine Kata
Instructions for executing the program:
1) Using a Windows machine, install .NET Core 2 from: https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/windows
(If you have a Mac or Linux, you can use those installer versions).
2) Clone or download this github repository.
3) Open a command prompt or powershell console (In Windows 10 is windows key + R, type powershell or cmd).
4) Go to PublishOutput folder in the downloaded github repository.
5) Type "dotnet VendingMachine.dll".

For this coding exercise, I used Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
It can be downloaded from https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/whatsnew/

I will be adding a web version of this kata with an Angular UI.
